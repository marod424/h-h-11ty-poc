Our Purpose

hearts+homes is a faith-based, volunteer-led, care ministry that lovingly furnishes fresh starts for special-circumstance families. We receive and share gently used, donated furniture and home goods at no cost to those we serve, which is exclusively: 

Underemployed single moms
Families and individuals emerging from crises (homelessness, domestic violence, etc.)
Refugees approved to settle in New Jersey’s Mercer and Middlesex counties

All of our clients live at or below 150% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines. They come to us with the full representation of one of our 11 local advocacy partners. While furnishings are essential to making a house a home, furnishings alone are not enough to ensure a family will thrive. We partner with advocacy organizations because families emerging from crises need holistic care that only professionally trained advocates––social workers, pastors, case managers, benevolence care providers––can offer. Working together, we make a difference in the family’s long-term well being, practically, emotionally, and spiritually.

Our advocacy partners complete a thorough application process confirming stated needs and annual household income. They contact hearts+homes to discuss opportunities to partner in caring for the family’s furnishing needs. Among other things, that conversation includes the sustainability of the family’s new housing situation and the timing of their needs. Because the advocacy relationship is so important to the family’s success, hearts+homes does not provide assistance to unrepresented clients. 

For qualified families, we offer single pieces of furniture to rooms of furniture as doorstep deliveries. All rooms are carefully coordinated to match and meet the family’s specific needs. We also offer turn-key full installations of 1–3 bedroom dwellings. In the case of full installations, we conduct home visits in advance to get to know the family, hear their hopes and dreams, and design a plan that’s as unique as the family itself. Safety, comfort, and the reestablishment of healthy family rhythms are always a priority. 

hearts+homes is undeniably a faith-based ministry that was incubated and launched as an independent charity by Princeton Alliance Church. It’s God’s concept and entirely based on His provision. While we operate under principles of biblical faith, we serve families of all faiths (or no faith) and do not discriminate for or against any person on the basis of ethnicity, nationality, place of origin, gender, religion, sexual orientation, marital status, familial status, economic status, age, or cognitive or physical ability.
