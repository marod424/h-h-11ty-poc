hearts+homes is a PAC partner that furnishes fresh starts for special-circumstance families in New Jersey’s Middlesex, Mercer, Monmouth, and Ocean counties. This vibrant, faith-based ministry provides for the furnishing needs of underemployed single moms, families emerging from crises (such as homelessness and domestic violence), and refugees approved to settle in Central Jersey.

hearts+homes’ clients typically live within 150% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines and come fully qualified through one of the ministry’s 11 advocacy partners (social services agencies, community organizations, and churches—like PAC—advocating for the marginalized). The beautiful, gently used furnishings and home goods provided to those in need are donated by local families who choose to share their belongings. hearts+homes is 100% volunteer led and driven and is funded by the generosity of people like you, through financial gifts and grants. Thank you for praying, serving, sharing your furnishings, and generously giving in support of this special ministry.
