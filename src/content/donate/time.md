## Opportunities to Serve
<em>Core Values: Service • Compassion • Generosity • Respect • Quality</em>

hearts+homes specializes in furnishing fresh starts. We provide beautiful, gently used furnishings to qualified, special-circumstance families at no cost to them. We do this by receiving furniture donations and partnering with churches, social services agencies, and community advocates to expand their footprints of care. We focus exclusively on assisting organizations that serve:

- Underemployed single moms
- Families and singles emerging from crisis
- Refugees approved for local resettlement by the U.S. State Department

hearts+homes is first and foremost a <em><b>care ministry</b></em> that focuses on the spiritual and practical needs of the families we serve. We are Christ-centered, Holy-Spirit led, and 100% volunteer driven. It’s volunteers like you, who obediently respond to God’s call to serve, who make this ministry possible.

#### Our Teams
There are many different ways you can use your gifts and life experiences to serve hearts+homes’ families. Below is a list of ways you could potentially be involved. It's important to us that our volunteers use their [spiritual gifts](https://spiritualgiftstest.com/spiritual-gifts-test-adult-version/) and find their sweet spot because that will bring the most joy and fulfillment. You’re welcome to serve on more than one team. You do not need to attend or be a member of Princeton Alliance Church to serve.

So take a look, feel free to ask questions, and let us know if you find anything appealing. We’ll be praying God guides you as you seek to strike the right balance in terms of family, work, and service.

      <h5>Ministry Services Team</h5>
      <p>Team members...</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Respond to donation calls</li>
         <li>Develop relationships with families sharing furnishings</li>
         <li>Listen to their stories (i.e., something usually prompted the furniture donation)</li>
         <li>Determine hearts+homes’ needs</li>
         <li>Schedule furniture pick-ups</li>
         <li>Enter received inventory via an easy-to-use mobile app</li>

      </ul>
      <p>
         Not everyone does everything. Some handle calls (compassion, patience, grace, and organization are a few of the traits required). Some handle inventory (detail orientation, organization, and comfort with basic app-based software are a few of the traits that are helpful here). Some handle administrative tasks (detail orientation, high accountability and self-starter skills, comfort with Google docs are a plus). Calls and administrative tasks are handled from home. Inventory is entered onsite because you have to see it to be able to describe and measure it to log it into the mobile system.

      <h5>Special Services Team</h5>
      <p>These are our creative “fixers” and “builders.”.</p>
      <p>Team members include...</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Seamstresses who sew onsite or at home (decorator pillows, placemats, table runners, cushions, curtains, etc.)</li>
         <li>Those who repair items that are worth fixing (lamps, clocks, etc.)</li>
         <li>Those who assemble furnishings for us when we receive “assembly required” items</li>
         <li>Craftsmen and women who actually build furnishings from a home workshop</li>
         <li>Those who help coordinate furnishing plans by assisting with furniture and decor selections from our inventory*</li>
         <li>Those who assist in locating free or nearly free items (via online groups and Facebook Marketplace) that we may be missing to complete a furnishing plan</li>
         <li>Those who are willing to dash out and complete porch pick-ups for the free or nearly free items mentioned above</li>
      </ul>
      <p>*To help coordinate furnishing plans, you must be familiar with the inventory we have on hand.</p>
   </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
   <div class="column">
      <h5>Upcycle Team</h5>
      <p>These are our wonderfully creative visionaries who can look at a piece of dated or worn furniture and <b>reimagine</b> a new look and purpose.</p>
      <p>Team members...</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Clean</li>
         <li>Sand or strip</li>
         <li>Re-paint</li>
         <li>Refinish</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         While we’re intentionally selective in terms of the furnishings we receive (typically respectfully declining 3 out of every 5 items), we always have a list of quality furnishings that need some additional love before they can be rehomed. No prior experience is required. We’ll start you off with a project appropriate to your comfort level and provide coaching along the way.

      <h5>Home-Visit Team</h5>
      <p>Home visits take several forms, and we select volunteers from each of the groups above for each type of interaction based on their gifts.</p>
      <p> We do home visits to:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Complete scheduled furniture pick-ups</li>
         <li>Assess a giving family's furnishings when they are closing up a home</li>
         <li>Assess a receiving family's living space so we can understand their needs and appropriately furnish their space</li>
         <li>Complete a Delivery Day furniture installation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         Our Home-Visit volunteers learn to tune into and minister to the spiritual, practical, and emotional needs of our clients. Experience goes a long way; the more often you do it, the better you are at it.

      <h5>Utility Players</h5>
      <p>
         Utility players––those who volunteer and ask the simple question, “What can I do to help you today?”––are the unsung heroes of the ministry. They don’t necessarily gravitate to one particular area but instead help across the board. While we value every volunteer and the unique gifts they bring to the hearts+homes team, our utility players are the ones who help us quickly cross the finish line of many projects. They clean, organize, move items, engage with clients, and cheerfully do what needs to be done. If you’re not sure which team you’d like to be a part of, this might be a good place to start.

      <h5>Load-in Team</h5>
      <p>Believe it or not, we frequently have volunteers say, "I just like to move stuff." These folks have the gift of service.</p>
      <p>Team members...</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Strategically load the truck for Delivery Day the night before, ensuring everything is properly organized and secured</li>
         <li>Help move and reorganize furniture in storage so we maximize space</li>
      </ul>
   </div>

      <div class="column">
         <h5>Care Team (Development Stage)</h5>
         <p>
            This team is in development and consists of those who assist us in caring for and ministering to giving families who are grieving a loss. It involves ensuring that grieving families who connect with hearts+homes have access to appropriate support.
         </p>
         <p>
            If God ordains, it is our dream to one day include social workers and counselors as part of our Care Team, shifting from grief care alone to broader care of the giving and receiving families we serve. Receiving families we serve are often emerging from crisis (homelessness, domestic violence, incarceration, poverty) and may need guidance in pursuing assistance available through the state and other resources or counseling services that would increase their probability of success.

#### Age Parameters
We love it when families serve hearts+homes together, but we do have age parameters for volunteering. This is primarily due to safety concerns, as many of our tasks include moving heavy furniture and using power tools.
- Teens age 15–17 can serve onsite as a hearts+homes volunteer with their parent or guardian present and serving alongside them.
- Young adults 18+ can serve with hearts+homes both on- and offsite ( including home visits/delivery days).
- Based on our current model, mission, and vision, we don't offer volunteer opportunities for children under age 15.

#### The Heart of hearts+homes
hearts+homes is undeniably a faith-based ministry. It’s God’s concept and entirely based on His provision; He merely tapped us on the shoulder and said, “I want you to do this for me.” So we humbly give Him all credit for any success that the ministry has experienced.

All are welcome to serve with hearts+homes regardless of their faith background––whether you’re starting to explore what faith means to you, you’ve been pursuing a faith-filled relationship with God for years, or you’re somewhere in between. While we never intentionally put our volunteers in uncomfortable positions, we do challenge their comfort zones. Our leaders pray before we begin team-based projects, and the expectation is that all of our volunteers, regardless of their faith background, will respect that. Our volunteers regularly hear about biblical generosity, how God calls us to give our best, how God provides for the needs associated with each project, how each moment they invest in a project is an act of worship, how Jesus provided for people’s spiritual and physical needs in tandem, how He showed compassion and respect to those He served, and lots more. It is always our hope that our volunteers will feel safe to ask faith-related questions, and as they feel comfortable, share their unique story with us.


#### Health Precautions
hearts+homes takes the health and safety of its volunteers very seriously. We place the needs and concerns of others before our own. Because we are a face-to-face ministry and enter our clients’ homes, we follow CDC guidelines for illnesses like RSV, Influenza, and COVID-19. Volunteers need not be vaccinated against the above to serve with hearts+homes. However, for safety, all volunteers are expected to remain home if they are unwell or mask as a courtesy if they are experiencing minor, cold-related symptoms.

#### Thank You
Thank you for taking time to consider these opportunities to serve. Please don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions about hearts+homes or the information provided. We’re delighted that you’re interested in the ministry and look forward to serving alongside you.
