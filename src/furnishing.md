## Furniture Donations

hearts+homes is a ministry of Princeton Alliance Church that specializes in “furnishing fresh starts.” We provide beautiful, gently used, donated furnishings to qualified, special-circumstance families at no cost to them. We focus exclusively on ministering to underemployed single moms, families emerging from crisis, and refugees approved to settle in Mercer/Middlesex counties by the US State Department.


If you’re interested in donating very gently used furnishings, home goods, or decorator items, email photos along with your location and timeframe to heartsandhomes@princetonalliance.org. We will reply within 48 hours of your contact, Monday–Friday. We are 100% volunteer led and volunteer driven, so thank you for your patience.

Please note we are <i>intentionally selective</i> and choose items based on current client needs, size/scale, condition, location, and timeframe. *Sofas are limited to specific dimensions because the apartments we furnish are small.

<b>For safety, we offer only curbside, driveway, garage, or porch pick-ups. We do not enter homes.</b>
